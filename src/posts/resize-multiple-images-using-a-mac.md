Resizing images can be a tedious task, especially if you have a large batch of them. But with the help of Preview on Mac, it’s a breeze! Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to batch resize pictures using Preview:

1) Select all the images you want to resize.

2) Right-click on them and select Open With > Preview.

3) In Preview, go to Edit > Select All.

4) Once all images are selected, go to Tools > Adjust Size.

5) Enter the desired width or height value to resize the photos. If you only want to resize the width, for example, ensure that "Scale Proportionally" is selected to keep the image proportions consistent. Take a moment to explore the other options available.

6) Once you have made your selections, click "OK". The images will be resized and saved to their original location, replacing the previous files.

Once you’ve entered the new size for the images, click Ok. The images will be resized and saved to the original location, replacing the original files.

As an extra step you can use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) to reduce the size of your images (and remove metadata if you intend to post them online). Just drag all the images to the imageOptim window and give it a few seconds.

And that’s it! With just a few simple steps, you can easily batch resize a large number of images using Preview on Mac. So the next time you need to resize a batch of pictures, remember to use Preview – it’s quick, easy, and gets the job done!
