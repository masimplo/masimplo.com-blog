👋 The default blog post I just installed...Hello World! I thought for a moment to delete it and start writing my own posts, but what more suitable for a welcoming post of the blog of a computer literate person - what many Greeks call "κομπιουτεράς" -

I have started several blogs and abandoned them due to lack of either time or appetite. This is another attempt to communicate what I know how to do well to the outside world. The topics that will concern this blog I have not yet defined well, but I imagine they will have to do with my studies, my work and my hobbies.

I hope this time the effort takes place and I don't forget this blog as I wonder off towards something brighter...
