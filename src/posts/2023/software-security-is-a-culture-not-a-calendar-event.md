As technology continues to evolve, the importance of security in software and infrastructure becomes more and more critical. However, many organizations still treat security as an ad-hoc review matter, rather than recognizing it as a fundamental aspect of the development and deployment process. Smaller companies, in particular, may face challenges in keeping up with larger corporations in terms of security due to limited resources and high recurring costs for security services.

One way small companies can address this challenge is by prioritizing security in all their processes. Every decision, from the use of third-party libraries, to how a service is architected and deployed, to the choice of data store and cloud provider, should take into account the potential impact on system security as a whole. Even seemingly small decisions, such as logging data for debugging purposes, can have significant security implications. A poorly maintained cold storage for backups, for example, can be a significant vulnerability in an otherwise well-secured system.

To truly address the challenge of security, small companies must establish a culture of security, where every member of the development team understands the importance of security and has the knowledge and tools to implement it. This culture should also involve regular training, security audits, and the incorporation of security considerations into the development process.

Another important aspect of a security culture is to ensure that security is integrated into the infrastructure itself. This can be done by using robust security protocols, such as encryption and authentication, and by deploying security tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and vulnerability management software.

Code reviews should not only focus on functionality, performance, and code (or formatting :O), but also on security aspects, such as where data is stored and how it is protected, how credentials are handled, and how the code reacts to unexpected data. Third-party libraries should be thoroughly assessed for existing issues and scanned by vulnerability detection tools before being integrated into the codebase. Automated software should also be used to regularly check code and artifacts to ensure they remain secure. This includes also re-deploying containers on a regular basis to make sure they are patched and up-to-date.

In conclusion, all companies, especially small, resource restricted ones, can take proactive steps to stay competitive with larger corporations by prioritizing security in all processes, establishing a culture of security and accountability, and integrating security into the infrastructure itself. Team members should actively pursue improvement of the system security at various points, and stay vigilant for potential security risks. Additionally, organizations should take advantage of available tools and resources to ensure their systems are regularly monitored and tested for vulnerabilities.
