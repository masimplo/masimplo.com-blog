Searching as always for something unrelated, I came across an article by red-team-design.com that shows a great way to create beautiful HTML tables with rounded corners and hover effects using CSS3.

I've read and followed several similar articles in the past, but this one seems to be the simplest and most effective, so I am quoting it here.

A demo can be found [here](http://red-team-design.com/dist/uploads/2011/10/practical-css3-tables-with-rounded-corners-demo.html) and the original article [Practical CSS3 tables with rounded corners â€“ RedTeamDesign](http://www.red-team-design.com/practical-css3-tables-with-rounded-corners).
